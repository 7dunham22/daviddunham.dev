## About

Hi everyone. My name's David Dunham, and I'm currently an software developer
with [Swish Data](https://www.swishdata.com).

Currently, I'm interested in frontend development within the context of generative AI applications. My main focus is to support AI & RAG search technologies in the public sector.

I hope this site will serve as a collection of my various thoughts, and I look forward to meeting new people in this area.
