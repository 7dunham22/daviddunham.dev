In creating this 'blog', I've only wanted to give myself a space to convey my professional identity in a particular way. I'm in no way interested in telling my full story here, but I feel obligated to start off with some lessons I've learned in the process of switching career paths into tech.

The gist of my background is that I was previously a German Studies PhD graduate who, in the course of a few years post-pandemic, transitioned to data science, then web development, then IT support, before eventually landing my current position as a software developer and government contractor. This was never part of any plan for my life. After graduating with my PhD and wanting to start a new chapter for my life, I took a web development bootcamp in 2022, then spent about a year on the job market before a lifelong friend introduced me to a connection that took my life in an entirely new direction. 

To get to the point, here are a few things I've learned:

1. *Boot camps are only good for certificates, but certificates matter.* 

> At this point, I'm pretty sure the boot camp fad is over (or at least it should be) and most people should understand the reality of this business. The program - which I will not name - took only 3.5 months to complete and cost me tuition that I'm still paying off today. The skill outcomes weren't adequate to get an entry-level job, as few as there were, but they certainly helped to get a strong coding foundation for those who had no experience before. That being said, what matters is the certificate at the end; and for the industry I ultimately landed in, these certs are everything. I don't know if I would have got the job I did without it.

2. *Learn the lessons of application scaling early on.*

> If you're learning to code in school, you're learning technologies and design patterns that are aimed at large-scale projects serving thousands of users. Because of that, everyone has a tendency to over-architect their tech stack to accommodate such a massive growth, when the reality is that most projects start with only a few users and don't need to grow much beyond that to serve their purpose as a proof of concept.

> My advice: Always create services to serve the users you already have: 1 (yourself). 

> A large portion of interesting software development work is learning to re-architect and re-deploy your work in a different way when something gets bigger, but these are decisions you need to make when the time comes, not when you're hitting the ground running.

3. *There are no transferable skills - just skills.*

> While completing my PhD, I already knew that I wanted to continue on to something new where I could pursue my interest in tech and have a real career, but how was I supposed to *transfer* my skills to that area? In other words, how was I supposed to use the things I excelled at then and twist them into a positive in another area? 

> The reality is that the strengths in your own field of study should be held as advantages in any endeavour in life. If your expertise is 18th century literature, then let that be part of your identity and be valuable in and of itself. You don't need to twist it into something else of economic value. Of course, you will need other skills to find a new job, but you still need to hold true and acknowledge the skills you've gained in your own words.

4. Stay true to your friends. They are the best connections you will ever get.

> I submitted over 700 applications over the course of a year. It took just one friend to introduce me to the company that hired me. That speaks for itself.
